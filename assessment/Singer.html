                        In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone.[1] Drums consist of at least one 
                        membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the
                        player's hands, or with a percussion mallet,<br> to produce sound. There is usually a resonant head on the underside of the drum. <br>
                        Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the

                        Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way.

                    Uses Drums are usually played by striking with the hand, a beater attached to a pedal, or with one or two sticks with or without padding. A wide variety of sticks are used,<br>
                    including wooden sticks and sticks with soft beaters of felt on the end. 
                    In jazz, some drummers use brushes for a smoother, quieter sound. In many traditional cultures, drums have a symbolic function and are used in religious ceremonies. 
                    Drums are often used in music therapy, especially hand drums,
                    because of their tactile nature and easy use by a wide variety of people. <br>
